This preprocessor is fully conformant to ANSI C89/ISO C90, except:

	- trigraphs are not supported, and
	- wide characters/string literals are not recognized.

These features were deliberately omitted, on the grounds that they're stupid.

When given the -x flag, C++ comments and tokens (::, ->, ->*) are honored.
This aligns the preprocessor with the C++ ARM, minus the digraphs and keyword
operators (e.g., 'and_eq') mentioned in chapter 19 (later adopted by C++98).
As with the missing C89 features cited above, these are deliberately omitted.

This code should be architecturally sound, though it has not been extensively
tested or performance tuned. There are undoubtedly many lurking [minor] bugs.
