There is only one compiler bug that I'm aware of and haven't fixed: a function
pointer must be dereferenced implicitly. That is,

int (*f)();

f();    /* works as expected */
(*f)(); /* error */

The logic in generate_call() (ncc1/gen.c) botches the job.
Easy enough to fix, just have to get around to it.
